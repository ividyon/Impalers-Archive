<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a compilation of all the text files in ELDEN RING: Shadow of the Erdtree already unpacked and converted to a readable format. Additionally all of the text files are aggregated into a single one with clearly marked sections and file pairs with Title-Descriptions already parsed. It does not account for mapping text to characters or items or any in-game information. This is merely a more convenient way of searching text within the game.

This is specially convenient for finding dialogue entries and also item descriptions without having to visit wikis all the time.

You can find the master dump in preview form here: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ividyon/Impalers-Archive/main/Master.html

The preview form for the Japanese dump is here: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ividyon/Impalers-Archive/main/MasterJP.html

### Built With

Twinmoon Archive is a fairly low effort copy of [Carian Archive](https://github.com/AsteriskAmpersand/Carian-Archive) by AsteriskAmpersand. Almost everything was made by them.
Files were unpacked through UXM Selective Unpack and then converted using WitchyBND.

* [WitchyBND](https://github.com/ividyon/WitchyBND)
* [UXM Selective Unpack](https://github.com/Nordgaren/UXM-Selective-Unpack)
