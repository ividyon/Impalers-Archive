<p>The circlet of light which adorned Miquella's head as he returned in divine aspect. It has begun to fade into nothingness.</p>
<p>Slightly boosts intelligence, faith, and arcane, while also boosting the power of Miquella's light.</p>
<p>This circle was to be the very foundation upon which Miquella's age of compassion would be built, should it have ever come to pass.</p>
<h3>Shadow Militiaman Helm [5280000]</h3>
<p>Helm as dark as shadow, worn by vulgar militiamen.</p>
<p>Freshly-singed battlegrounds effusing with the stench of the dead. Forbidden lands that will be excised from the memory of history. What better place than the realms of shadow then, for such an army?</p>
<h3>Shadow Militiaman Armor [5280100]</h3>
<p>Armor as dark as shadow, worn by vulgar militiamen.</p>
<p>Freshly-singed battlegrounds effusing with the stench of the dead. Forbidden lands that will be excised from the memory of history. What better place than the realms of shadow then, for such an army?</p>
<h3>Shadow Militiaman Gauntlets [5280200]</h3>
<p>Gauntlets as dark as shadow, worn by vulgar militiamen.</p>
<p>Freshly-singed battlegrounds effusing with the stench of the dead. Forbidden lands that will be excised from the memory of history. What better place than the realms of shadow then, for such an army?</p>
<h3>Shadow Militiaman Greaves [5280300]</h3>
<p>Greaves as dark as shadow, worn by vulgar militiamen.</p>
<p>Freshly-singed battlegrounds effusing with the stench of the dead. Forbidden lands that will be excised from the memory of history. What better place than the realms of shadow then, for such an army?</p>
<h3>Divine Beast Head [5290000]</h3>
<p>Ritual headwear in the form of a divine beast's head, used to perform the lion dance. Worn by the very finest of the sculpted keepers. Alas, it no longer responds to the old woman's earnest prayer.</p>
<p>Divine invocation heightens intensity of the storm alongside strength and dexterity, but reduces the restorative effect of drinking from a flask of sacred tears.</p>
<p>Focus is also troubled by wearing this headwear.</p>
<h3>St. Trina's Blossom [5300000]</h3>
<p>St. Trina's life withered and fell, as fleeting as the seasons. At her last, she left a single water lily.</p>
<p>Slightly boosts max FP.</p>
<p>Despite the velvety-purple hue, the flower is in no way poisonous—it merely blooms in quietude.</p>
<h3>Crucible Hammer-Helm [5310000]</h3>
<p>Helm worn by Devonia, longest-serving of the Crucible Knights.</p>
<p>Holds the power of the crucible of life, the primordial form of the Erdtree. Strengthens Aspects of the Crucible incantations.</p>
<p>It is said Devonia quested in search of the Crucible's origin, and departed from the lands of the Erdtree alone.</p>
<h3>Greatjar [5320000]</h3>
<p>A greatjar which fits comfortably over the head when upturned. Attire of the shamans who perform their worship at gaols.</p>
<p>Increases the power of thrown pots of all sizes.</p>
<p>They offer their prayers to the innards of the greatjars, such that they might be reborn one day into sainthood. This is the cycle of death and rebirth, taken into the hands of mortal men.</p>
<h3>Imp Head (Lion) [5330000]</h3>
<p>Head covering made from the largely unaltered head of an impish golem.</p>
<p>Resembling a lion in appearance, life force faintly clings to it.</p>

[1030500010] Ah ha ha ha!<br />
[1030500020] What a sight! A warrior true, if ever one there was!<br />
[1030500030] A fellow drake warrior!<br />
[1030500040] Igon, piteous Igon, do you not remember?<br />
[1030500050] Conjure your past! How once you were!<br />

<p>[1030600000] Ahh, drake warrior, dear friend.<br />
[1030600010] Grant me this one wish.<br />
[1030600020] Take this finger. My finger.<br />
[1030600030] Scale the jagged peak. Face Bayle the Dread. And when you do...<br />
[1030600040] Summon me. Summon my soul.<br />
[1030600050] My limbs are limbs no more. My heart is twice-over filled with fear.<br />
[1030600060] But a drake warrior I remain.<br />
[1030600070] And my soul yet lies on the mountain.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1030610000] Proud drake warrior, I beg of you.<br />

<p>[1030700000] Curse you, Bayle!<br />

<p>[1031700000] Hah... Hah...<br />

[1031700030] Take this finger. My finger.<br />

[1031700050] Summon me. Summon my soul.<br />
[1031700060] My limbs are limbs no more. My heart is twice-over filled with fear.<br />

<h3>10601</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1060100000] Warrior true.<br />
[1060100010] Picture yourself. Feasting upon a dragon's essence.<br />
[1060100020] On the throbbing heart of the oldest, vilest dragon of them all.<br />
[1060100030] It would be the purest form of Communion.<br />
[1060100040] The fullest sating of your hunger,<br />
[1060100050] and your consummation, as a dragon whole.  </p>
<h3>10602</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1060200000] Yes, as it should be.<br />
[1060200010] Now, seek the jagged peak.<br />
[1060200020] There you will find Bayle, the oldest, and vilest, of all dragons.<br />
[1060200030] Landbound warrior. Follow your desire, and slay the foul beast.<br />
[1060200040] Devour its throbbing heart.<br />
[1060200050] I will grant you the strength required.<br />
[1060200060] In the name of my lord, Placidusax.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1060210000] Perhaps you have yet to feel true want.<br />
[1060210010] I am patient.<br />
[1060210020] There will come a day when hunger knocks.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1060220000] Warrior true. Do you feel the hunger?<br />
[1060220010] Then why not feast upon a dragon's essence.<br />
[1060220020] On the throbbing heart of the oldest, vilest dragon of them all.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1060250000] Warrior true. What is it that you need?  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[1060260000] Very well.<br />
[1060260010] If you hunger for Dragon Communion,<br />
[1060260020] and seek to slay Bayle, the vilest of dragons,<br />
[1060260030] then I shall grant you strength time and again.<br />
[1060260040] In the name of my lord, Placidusax.  </p>
<h3>10603</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1060300000] In a time long past, Bayle turned upon the Dragonlord.<br />
[1060300010] The foul traitor assailed our master and inflicted a grievous wound, only to make a hasty retreat.<br />
[1060300020] ...Becoming a sworn enemy of the brood.<br />
[1060300030] Since that day, Bayle and his bloodline—the drakes— have served as sacrifices for Dragon Communion.<br />
[1060300040] Landbound warrior. My lord, Placidusax, has shown your kind what must be done.<br />
[1060300050] Seek communion. Sate your boundless appetite.<br />
[1060300060] Feel the euphoria of a dragon's essence taking root in your meagre frame.  </p>
<h3>10604</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1060400000] I remember that name well.<br />
[1060400010] The broken drake warrior.<br />
[1060400020] Driven by bottomless hunger and fiery ambition.<br />
[1060400030] Precisely what the Dragonlord envisaged.<br />
[1060400040] for men who partake in Dragon Communion.<br />
[1060400050] The mad hunger and fierceness of spirit that only flows from those young and short of sight.<br />
[1060400060] He rather reminds me of Bayle, in fact.<br />
[1060400070] Such thoughts are unfathomable to ones as old as we.  </p>
<h3>10605</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1060500000] My dear lord, Placidusax.<br />
[1060500010] Tonight, like every night, my solace is yours.<br />
[1060500020] May it grant you sleep, in your place beyond time.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[1060501000] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1060510000] Ah...  </p>

<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1060600000] ...  </p>
<h3>10607</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1060700000] I have broken my pledge.<br />
[1060700010] I succumbed to the deep slumber...<br />
[1060700020] ...that was meant for my Lord.<br />
[1060700030] Twas a craven act! Of a foul and lowly beast!<br />
[1060700040] Forgive me, good warrior.<br />
[1060700050] My Lord will no longer look upon me.<br />
[1060700060] I have fallen from grace. An old dragon no longer.<br />
[1060700070] Go on, leave me be.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1060710000] Go on, leave me be.<br />
[1060710010] My Lord will no longer look upon me.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1060720000] Ahh, finally, our wish is granted.<br />
[1060720010] Our dream, long yearned for, has come to pass.<br />
[1060720020] My Lord was blessed with great insight.<br />
[1060720030] He saw in the insatiable hunger and fierce spirit of man,<br />
[1060720040] the very things that would fell Bayle, our wretched nemesis.<br />
[1060720050] Warrior, you soar with the strength of dragons.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[1060721000] Whereas I am fallen. Leave me be.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[1060730000] Good warrior, leave me be.<br />
[1060730010] I can call myself an old dragon no longer.  </p>
<h3>10608</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1060800000] Is that the truth?<br />
[1060800010] Never, in all my years...<br />
[1060800020] How could you inflict such cruelty?<br />
[1060800030] No, that is not for me to judge.<br />
[1060800040] Whatever your hand in it, it was I who succumbed to the sweetness of slumber.<br />
[1060800050] The fault lies with me.<br />
[1060800060] I may be fallen, but I need not surrender my honour.  </p>
<h3>10609</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1060900000] ...<br />
[1060900010] On second thought,<br />
[1060900020] I believe you do owe me something for the transgression.<br />
[1060900030] On a mere whim, you've stripped me of my one and only Lord.<br />
[1060900040] As such, I require another—you.<br />
[1060900050] One day, may you become a dragon whole, a Lord of your own making.<br />
[1060900060] Lead me, and I will follow.<br />
[1060900070] My good Lord.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>

<p>[1070600000] Lord of the old order.<br />
[1070600010] Let us go together.<br />
[1070600020] Come, now. Let us go together.  </p>
<h3>10707</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1070700000] I promise you.<br />
[1070700010] A thousand year voyage guided by compassion.<br />
[1070700100] Let your thoughts...be only of love.  </p>
<h3>10901</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1090100000] I've no interest in small talk.<br />
[1090100010] My only concerns are the concerns of Count Ymir.<br />
[1090100020] And you are not among them.  </p>
<h3>10902</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1090200000] Only, there is one thing I will say.<br />
[1090200010] Count Ymir's kindness is a gift. Should you cross him,<br />
[1090200020] you will sorely regret it.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1090210000] Be gone.<br />
[1090210010] There is nothing more to say.  </p>
<h3>10903</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1090300000] How did you...<br />
[1090300010] Did Count Ymir reward you with that?<br />
[1090300020] Hmm.<br />
[1090300030] Then I see you have gained his trust.<br />
[1090300040] And therefore, mine.<br />
[1090300050] I am Jolán. The Night is yours now to wield.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[1090305000] Count Ymir spoke of you.<br />
[1090305010] That you had earned his trust.<br />
[1090305020] Hmm.<br />
[1090305030] Then you have earned mine, as well.<br />
[1090305040] I am Jolán. The Night is yours now to wield.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1090310000] Don't get the wrong idea.<br />
[1090310010] We are neither friends nor confidantes.<br />
[1090310020] I am merely honouring Count Ymir's wishes.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1090320000] Enough of you.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1090350000] Well, well, what is that...<br />
[1090350010] A reward from Count Ymir?<br />
[1090350020] Huh...<br />
[1090350030] If the Count has placed his trust in you, then so shall I.<br />
[1090350040] I am Jolán. The Night is yours now to wield.  </p>
<h4>Section 55</h4>
<p>[1090355000] Ahh, who have we here...?<br />
[1090355010] Count Ymir spoke of you.<br />
[1090355020] That you had earned his trust.<br />
[1090355030] Hmm.<br />
[1090355040] Then you have earned mine, as well.<br />
[1090355050] I am Jolán. The Night is yours now to wield.  </p>
<h3>10904</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1090400000] I told you once.<br />
[1090400010] I've no interest in companionship.<br />
[1090400020] But I must admit.<br />
[1090400030] Count Ymir did seem very pleased.<br />
[1090400040] Perhaps an exception is in order.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1090450000] Ahh, who have we here...?<br />
[1090450010] Count Ymir seemed very pleased.<br />
[1090450020] And for that, I express my gratitude.<br />
[1090450030] I am Jolán. Loyal to Count Ymir.<br />
[1090450040] The Night is yours now to wield.  </p>
<h3>10905</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1090500000] Ymir is a shining star.<br />
[1090500010] In our eyes, the only star upon the black canvas of the night.<br />
[1090500020] Our meeting with the Count taught us of the star-draped sky.<br />
[1090500030] We know that we cannot reach out to touch it.<br />
[1090500040] But we can peer up at its brilliance, and heed its guidance.<br />
[1090500050] We will never again lose our way in the night.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1090510000] I have spoken far too freely.<br />
[1090510010] Pay me no mind. Let us focus on our shared purpose.<br />
[1090510020] Our service to Count Ymir.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1090520000] Now, be on your way.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1090550000] Tell me.<br />
[1090550010] Where did you find this?<br />
[1090550020] Hmm.<br />
[1090550030] No, do not explain.<br />
[1090550040] I have one star alone.<br />
[1090550050] And only his words will do...  </p>
<h4>Section 55</h4>
<p>[1090555000] Stop.<br />
[1090555010] What did you just say?<br />
[1090555020] Hmmm.<br />
[1090555030] Wait, no. Say nothing.<br />
[1090555040] I have one star alone.<br />
[1090555050] And only his words will do...  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[1090560000] I will say this much.<br />
[1090560010] I am in your debt.<br />
[1090560020] But I will hear no more.<br />
[1090560030] I have one star alone.<br />
[1090560040] And only his words will do...  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[1090570000] Be on your way.<br />
[1090570010] I will hear no more about this.  </p>
<h3>10906</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1090600000] You were warned.<br />
[1090600010] Not to betray the kindness of Count Ymir.<br />
[1090600020] Appalling. Your lot never ceases to repulse me.<br />
[1090600030] Such willingness to exploit true largesse.<br />
[1090600040] Surrender. To the Night of Jolán.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1090650000] You have betrayed the kindness of Count Ymir.<br />
[1090650010] Appalling. Your lot never ceases to repulse me.<br />
[1090650020] Such willingness to exploit true largesse.<br />
[1090650030] Surrender. To the Night of Jolán.  </p>
<h3>10907</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1090700000] What have you done?<br />
[1090700010] You've wounded Count Ymir most irreparably.<br />
[1090700020] Such that he wishes for your death.<br />
[1090700030] And I must attend to the Count's concerns.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1090750000] You would abscond with it.<br />
[1090750010] The whole of Count Ymir's wisdom?<br />
[1090750020] You undeserving little miscreant.<br />
[1090750030] Surrender. To the Night of Jolán.  </p>
<h3>10908</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1090800000] You have only yourself to blame, base creature.  </p>

<p>[1090810000] Count Ymir...<br />
[1090810010] I, Jolán, am afraid that I...  </p>

<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1090900000] Why...<br />
[1090900010] Why did you cross Count Ymir?  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1090920000] Oh, my dear star...<br />
[1090920010] A fine mother...you will be...  </p>

<p>[1091100000] Surrender. To the Night of Jolán.  </p>

<p>[1091200000] Count Ymir...<br />
[1091200010] The stars...the sky... I see them not...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1091210000] The Night is ever-dark.<br />
[1091210010] I need the stars... Give me light.  </p>
<h3>10913</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1091300000] Oh, it blinds...<br />
[1091300010] As if our Night simply never was...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1091310000] No light...anywhere at all...<br />
[1091310010] This is the night I know. Our Night...  </p>

<p>[1130100000] Those stripped of the Grace of Gold shall all meet death.<br />
[1130100010] In the embrace of Messmer's flame.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1130110000] All ye spurned by Grace.<br />
[1130110010] Kneel evermore. Before the flame of Messmer.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1130120000] Mark my words, graceless heathen.<br />
[1130120010] Thou shalt not evade the flame of Messmer.  </p>
<h3>11302</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1130200010] Thou shalt not evade the flame of Messmer.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1130210000] Queen Marika, behold!<br />
[1130210010] I have excised another. Another cancer to thy joy.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1130220000] Ahh, how could this be...<br />
[1130220010] Forsake me not...<br />
[1130220020] Queen Marika, my grace...  </p>
<h3>11303</h3>

<p>[1130300000] Queen Marika, mother to us all.<br />
[1130300010] Favour me with thy grace.<br />
[1130300020] I have met many who would threaten or
distress thee, and quelled each and all.<br />
[1130300030] And I hereby swear to never cease.<br />
[1130300040] So, please, grant me thy grace.<br />
[1130300050] Leave me with my solitary light...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1130310000] Queen Marika, I implore thee, bestow thy grace.<br />

<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1130400000] Ahh!<br />
[1130400010] Queen Marika. Dearest mother!<br />
[1130400020] I shall silence all who would trespass upon thy peace.<br />
[1130400030] As decreed by the Grace of Gold.<br />
[1130400040] Ahhh! No soul shall thy sanctity imperil!  </p>
<h3>11305</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1130500000] Ahh, ahh...<br />
[1130500010] I would not. Am I not pure? Defile thee, I would never.<br />
[1130500020] I ask, why wouldst thou think to purloin from me?<br />
[1130500030] Deignest thou not to look upon me?<br />
[1130500040] All this time, I held in my heart only thee!  </p>

<h3>11401</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1140100000] Fie, another? Treading the heels of Miquella?<br />
[1140100010] Then, as that woman would surely say, we are in our purposes well aligned...<br />
[1140100020] But understand—your kind are not forgiven.<br />
[1140100030] The Erdtree is my peoples' enemy—By Marika long betray'd, set aflame.<br />
[1140100040] I believe Miquella's apologies, when he says our delivery will come...<br />
[1140100050] But never will I see your kind as worthy.  </p>
<h3>11402</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1140200000] And yet, my oath I cannot overlook.<br />
[1140200010] If Miquella it is whom you would seek, then comrade, allow me to give you this.<br />
[1140200020] These are the sites of the crosses I've found.<br />
[1140200030] I urge you, follow after Miquella.<br />
[1140200040] As long as you abide by his footfalls, you will be no enemy to me.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1140210000] I urge you, follow after Miquella.<br />
[1140210010] As long as you abide by his footfalls, you will be no enemy to me.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1140220000] You have a knack for timing, my fellow.<br />
[1140220010] I've found the site of a new cross. Take this.<br />
[1140220050] New sites of crosses discovered. For you.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[1140230000] Miquella has said as much himself—he wishes now to throw it all away.<br />
[1140230010] He says the act—though undoubtedly painful—will sear clean the Erdtree's wanton sin.<br />
[1140230020] The truth of his claim can be found at each cross.<br />
[1140230030] Tis evidence enough to earn my belief.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[1140240000] Go to the misshapen tree of umbra.<br />
[1140240010] In that forsaken place, blood must spill—the blood of your fellows, the Erdtree faithful.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1140250000] Fie, another? Treading the heels of Miquella?<br />
[1140250010] Then, as that woman would surely say, we are in our purposes well aligned...<br />
[1140250020] But understand—your kind are not forgiven.<br />
[1140250030] The Erdtree is my peoples' enemy—By Marika long betray'd, set aflame.<br />
[1140250040] I believe Miquella's apologies, when he says our delivery will come...<br />
[1140250050] But never will I see your kind as worthy.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[1140260000] And yet, my oath I cannot overlook.<br />
[1140260010] If Miquella it is whom you would seek, then comrade, allow me to give you this.<br />
[1140260020] It'll show you where crosses can be found.  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[1140270000] What's this?<br />
[1140270010] Do you think me in need of alms?<br />
[1140270020] Ah, but this dish...<br />
[1140270030] Tis fare o'the tower. I remember fondly this kin-clad scent.<br />
[1140270040] ...Brings back memories I'd all but forgot.<br />
[1140270050] This, by my troth, is but a dismal copy.<br />
[1140270060] Indeed, I think it rather plain to see...<br />
[1140270070] Things once broken can never be the same...  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[1140280000] Look. Take this for your troubles, won't you?<br />
[1140280010] I desire not to be in your debt.  </p>
<h4>Section 90</h4>
<p>[1140290000] I've had my fill...<br />
[1140290010] Indeed, I have no wish...to wax nostalgic 'bout days gone by...<br />
[1140290020] Nor do I yearn to friendship kindle...  </p>
<h3>11403</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1140300000] Intriguing. What remains there to be said?<br />
[1140300010] Do you presume us allies, even now? Though Miquella's spell is newly broken?<br />
[1140300020] I must profess, the spell mattered little.<br />
[1140300030] Uphold his covenant Miquella shall, and in godhood redeem our rueful clan.<br />
[1140300040] Then Marika, and vilest Erdtree both, will at last be from divinity wrench'd.<br />
[1140300050] And surely I...contented I will be.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1140350000] Fie, another? Treading the heels of Miquella?<br />
[1140350010] A brazen fellow you must surely be, to loose your tongue to a stranger as I.<br />
[1140350020] Do you presume us allies, even now? Though Miquella's spell is newly broken?<br />
[1140350030] I must profess, the spell mattered little.<br />
[1140350040] Uphold his covenant Miquella shall, and in godhood redeem our rueful clan.<br />
[1140350050] Then Marika, and vilest Erdtree both, will at last be from divinity wrench'd.<br />
[1140350060] And surely I...contented I will be.  </p>
<h3>11404</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1140400000] But first, clear resounds the call of vengeance.<br />
[1140400010] The impaler, Messmer, must pay his due.<br />
[1140400020] In vengeance for the flames, my blade I wield...<br />
[1140400040] How could I allow myself to forget?<br />
[1140400050] Revenge alone assures me peace of mind.  </p>
<h3>11405</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1140500000] Think not to hinder me upon my path.<br />
[1140500010] Lest you too wish to face the reckoning.  </p>
<h3>11406</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1140600000] Messmer! Foe of my beloved people!<br />
[1140600010] In vengeance for the flames, my blade I wield!  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1140610000] Have I made it known, accursed Messmer?<br />
[1140610010] My clan's suff'ring? Their pain? All that they felt?<br />
[1140610020] Do you understand now, your ugliness?<br />
[1140610030] Aaaaaargh!  </p>
<h3>11407</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1140700000] We meet again I see, comrade-in-arms.<br />
[1140700010] Upon his end, did you see Messmer's face?<br />
[1140700020] Twas sublime—a very tangle of snakes!<br />
[1140700030] To think he dared to call us savages.<br />
[1140700040] When he himself was most base of all.<br />
[1140700050] Ha ha ha ha!  </p>
<h3>11408</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1140800000] To say the least, I am to you indebted.<br />
[1140800010] Yet unquenched remains my thirst for revenge.<br />
[1140800020] The death of Messmer was merely the start.<br />
[1140800030] Now comes the piper to collect from Marika, her offspring, and all the Erdtree's denizens...<br />
[1140800040] In vengeance for the flames, my blade I wield...<br />
[1140800060] If Miquella's redemption soothes the ache...that throbs within, demanding blessed vengeance...<br />
[1140800070] Then I wish not to be by him redeemed.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1140810000] If Miquella's redemption soothes the ache...that throbs within, demanding blessed vengeance...<br />
[1140810010] Then I wish not to be by him redeemed.  </p>
<h3>11409</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1140900000] What cruelty's this...<br />
[1140900010] Who would rob me of my one vital purpose?<br />
[1140900020] Am I so feeble, witless, dull of blade...<br />
[1140900030] That vengeance was never to have been mine?  </p>
<h3>11410</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1141000000] O mother, O most cherished wife and child.<br />
[1141000010] It seems vengeance was not mine to enact.<br />
[1141000020] Where now should I point my tired blade...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1141010000] Where now should I point my tired blade...  </p>
<h3>11411</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1141100000] In the end, I knew this day would come.<br />
[1141100010] The nature of your kind, I am certain, will always show itself, given time.<br />
[1141100020] Interfere not with my business, zealot.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1141110000] What could your purpose possibly be?<br />
[1141110010] I do not recollect begging for help.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1141120000] I ask you stay back—this is my revenge.  </p>
<h3>11412</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>

[1141200020] Interfere not with my business, zealot.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1141210000] So, your mongrel blood shows through at last.<br />
[1141210010] I was a fool to expect more of you.<br />
[1141210020] Small wonder Miquella employed his spells.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1141220000] Do not interfere—this is my revenge.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[1141230000] Apologies...<br />
[1141230010] O Mother, wife, and...chil...  </p>

[1150200020] Things bring joy to all.  </p>
<h3>11503</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1150300000] One of the forager brood was killed.<br />

[1150300020] This thing, cannot be forgiven.  </p>
<h3>11504</h3>

<p>[1150550000] Oh, I know.<br />
[1150550010] Give this to Thiollier.<br />
[1150550020] He asked me to find it.<br />
[1150550030] I finally found it.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>

<h3>11506</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1150600000] I don't feel it. It's broken.<br />
[1150600010] Kind Miquella's light is gone.<br />
[1150600020] But I stand tall.<br />
[1150600030] Together, we work.<br />
[1150600040] Together, for Miquella the Kind.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1150610000] I never change.<br />

<h3>11507</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1150700000] I don't know what to do.<br />
[1150700010] Our mother abandoned her brood.<br />
[1150700020] She did not love us.<br />
[1150700030] We are her children, what should we do?<br />
[1150700040] Must we be sad forever?  </p>
<h3>11508</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1150800000] Hm.<br />
[1150800010] Maybe that's Kindly Miquella's love.<br />
[1150800020] Love for all the unloved.<br />
[1150800030] Love, to banish the pain.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1150810000] Yes.<br />
[1150810010] The unloved, every single one of us...<br />

[1160100020] But now, like you, another soul guided by Kindly Miquella.<br />
[1160100030] I'm hardly the steady hand I once was. My fighting days are far behind me.<br />
[1160100040] Which is why I have chosen to dedicate myself to investigation.<br />
[1160100050] To discern Tender Miquella's ultimate purpose.<br />
[1160100060] I'd rather not volunteer service to a new master unless I know that I can be of use.  </p>
<h3>11602</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1160200000] May I request a service of you?<br />
[1160200020] They are akin to Tender Miquella's footprints. Or gravestones, which mark what he's left behind.<br />
[1160200030] If you discover any more crosses,<br />
[1160200040] be certain to tell me.<br />
[1160200050] I presume you, too, are keen to know.<br />
[1160200060] Just what Kind Miquella is doing here.<br />
[1160200110] Six crosses, identical to this one, have been discovered in these lands.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1160210000] If you discover any more crosses,<br />
[1160210010] be certain to tell me.<br />
[1160210020] I presume you, too, are keen to know.<br />
[1160210030] Just what Kind Miquella is doing here.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1160220000] Righteous Tarnished. What brings you here?  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1160250000] Oh, you must mean Sir Moore.<br />
[1160250010] Sir Moore is a kind and stalwart ally.<br />
[1160250020] He provisions our little outfit.<br />
[1160250030] Sir Moore traffics with the forager brood.<br />
[1160250040] His brethren who collect supplies from all corners of the land.<br />
[1160250050] No doubt they find inspiration in his many virtues.<br />
[1160250060] These are not your foes, Tarnished.<br />
[1160250070] Should you spot any forager brood, be sure to mind your manners.  </p>
<h3>11603</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1160300000] Well, I am much obliged.<br />
[1160300010] As suspected, Kindly Miquella has visited the lands which hold the tower.<br />
[1160300020] And appears intent on wholly dispossessing himself of his flesh.<br />
[1160300030] He must be seeking entrance to the tower of shadow.  </p>
<h3>11604</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1160400000] Well, I am much obliged.<br />
[1160400010] I can hardly believe it, he's divested himself of his very eye...<br />
[1160400020] Tender Miquella's eye is no mere morsel of flesh.<br />
[1160400030] It is a vessel of soaring grace. Proof of his Empyrean lineage.<br />
[1160400050] I wonder, does Miquella the Kind intend to sever his very birthright?<br />
[1160400060] His fate as a child of the Erdtree?  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1160450000] Well, I am much obliged.<br />
[1160450010] To think there was a cross left in such a faraway place...<br />
[1160450020] And that deep-purple water lilies would be blooming there.<br />
[1160450030] This can only mean Kindly Miquella has divested himself even of that...<br />
[1160450040] His adoring other self, his blossom of slumber.  </p>
<h3>11605</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1160500000] Righteous Tarnished. I have reasoned through my findings.<br />
[1160500010] Concerning Kind Miquella's intentions—why he is here.<br />
[1160500020] The full picture is yet to coalesce,<br />
[1160500030] but we do know that he is bound for the tower of shadow.<br />
[1160500040] And that is where he intends to rise to true godhood...<br />
[1160500050] The tower of shadow houses a divine gateway.<br />
[1160500060] A well-kept secret, it was, but...<br />
[1160500070] The gateway was once the birthplace of a god.<br />
[1160500080] A god we know all too well.  </p>
<h3>11606</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1160600000] Kindly Miquella has discarded his Great Rune.<br />
[1160600010] The fog that vexed my aging faculties has been lifted.<br />
[1160600020] And follies better left forgotten haunt me once again.<br />
[1160600030] ...<br />
[1160600040] Once, in an attempt to free Lord Mohg from his enchantment,<br />
[1160600050] I challenged Tender Miquella, only to have my own heart rather artfully stolen.<br />
[1160600060] I knew not how weak I was.<br />
[1160600070] I believed that with sufficient mastery, even an Empyrean would be within reach of my blade.<br />
[1160600080] I could not have been more mistaken...<br />
[1160600090] Miquella the Kind...is a monster.<br />
[1160600100] Pure and radiant, he wields love to shrive clean the hearts of men.<br />
[1160600110] There is nothing more terrifying.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1160610000] Righteous Tarnished. Miquella the Kind makes my blood run cold.<br />
[1160610010] I am loath to admit it, but even at this very instant I wish to run very far away indeed.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1160650000] You must be the Tarnished.<br />
[1160650010] I am Ansbach. Formerly in service to Lord Mohg.<br />
[1160650020] But now, like you, another soul guided by Kindly Miquella.<br />
[1160650030] I'm hardly the steady hand I once was. My fighting days are far behind me.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[1160660000] Yes, I am well aware.<br />
[1160660010] Kindly Miquella has discarded his Great Rune.<br />
[1160660020] The fog that vexed my aging faculties has been lifted.<br />
[1160660030] And follies better left forgotten haunt me once again.<br />
[1160660040] ...<br />
[1160660050] Once, in an attempt to free Lord Mohg from his enchantment,<br />
[1160660060] I challenged Tender Miquella, only to have my own heart rather artfully stolen.<br />
[1160660070] I knew not how weak I was.<br />
[1160660080] I believed that with sufficient mastery, even an Empyrean would be within reach of my blade.<br />
[1160660090] I could not have been more mistaken...<br />
[1160660100] Miquella the Kind...is a monster.<br />
[1160660110] Pure and radiant, he wields love to shrive clean the hearts of men.<br />
[1160660120] There is nothing more terrifying.  </p>
<h3>11607</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1160700000] Righteous Tarnished. It's been some time.<br />
[1160700010] After unburdening my soul to you, I had hoped to make a fresh start.<br />
[1160700020] But there was one thought I could not dislodge from my mind.<br />
[1160700030] So here I am, quite unable to move on.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[1160701020] ...There was one thought I could not dislodge from my mind.  </p>
<h3>11608</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1160800000] After Lord Mohg's slaying at his dynastic palace,<br />
[1160800010] it appears his body has been absconded with.<br />
[1160800020] And taken straight to Kind Miquella.<br />
[1160800030] Surely you recall that I once served Lord Mohg as a Pureblood Knight.<br />
[1160800040] After failing him in every regard, and losing sight of my vows,<br />
[1160800050] I'd do anything to make amends, in whatever meagre way I can.  </p>
<h3>11609</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1160900000] What could they possibly have in mind for Lord Mohg's remains?<br />
[1160900010] The implications are rather...unnerving.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1160950000] Freyja, by the gods...<br />
[1160950010] She must be feeling the need to reaffirm her allegiance before she heads to war...<br />
[1160950020] A true Redmane she is, hardly troubled by the rot.<br />
[1160950030] But no-one is without their shortcomings...<br />
[1160950040] She has a hard road ahead...  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[1160960000] Hmm, it does make one think...<br />
[1160960010] Perhaps our concerns are but two sides of the same coin?  </p>
<h3>11610</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1161000000] Well, what's this...<br />
[1161000010] ...<br />
[1161000020] Yes, yes, I should have known.<br />
[1161000030] Even the truth was itself mere folly.<br />
[1161000040] As if using Lord Mohg to gain entrance to the land of shadow were not enough,<br />
[1161000050] he plans to use his corpse as the vessel of his king consort.<br />
[1161000060] He has forsaken Lord Mohg's soul. He desires only his empty shell.<br />
[1161000070] It beggars belief, but…<br />
[1161000080] I'm afraid Tender Miquella fails to grasp the humiliation implied by this act.<br />
[1161000090] One thing is certain. My dear lord deserved better.  </p>
<h3>11611</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1161100000] Righteous Tarnished. You have my gratitude.<br />
[1161100010] You have given me the answers I needed.<br />
[1161100020] But I can hardly fathom it. Such folly, unto the end.<br />
[1161100030] I am a warrior, but I've aged. I cannot afford to act hastily.<br />
[1161100040] Curse it all. I know my limits.<br />
[1161100050] I could spend the rest of my life honing my craft, and still that creature would be out of my blade's reach.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1161110000] The absolute folly of it all.  </p>
<h3>11612</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1161200000] Righteous Tarnished.<br />
[1161200010] Could you please give this to Freyja?<br />
[1161200020] Thanks to you, she, too, will have the answer she requires.<br />
[1161200030] Freyja possesses a youth I no longer have.<br />
[1161200040] This knowledge will surely stoke the flames of valour within her.<br />
[1161200050] Yes, I can see her barreling into the fray right now...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1161210000] Perhaps I shouldn't meddle in her affairs...<br />
[1161210010] But this is the only way I can help...  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1161250000] Freyja, by the gods...<br />
[1161250010] She must be feeling the need to reaffirm her allegiance before she heads to war...<br />
[1161250020] A true Redmane she is, hardly troubled by the rot.<br />
[1161250030] ...<br />
[1161250040] Righteous Tarnished.<br />
[1161250050] Could you please give this to Freyja?<br />
[1161250060] Thanks to you, she, too, will have the answer she requires.<br />
[1161250070] Yes, I can see her barreling into the fray right now...  </p>
<h3>11613</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1161300000] Ha ha ha...<br />
[1161300010] I should have expected as much from Freyja!<br />
[1161300020] Some things simply never occur to her.<br />
[1161300030] Paralyzing fear. True despair.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1161310000] That's Freyja, through and through.  </p>
<h3>11621</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1162100000] Ungh...<br />
[1162100010] What on earth is the matter?  </p>
<h3>11622</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1162200000] Have you come to your senses?<br />
[1162200010] Now, there's no need for any hand-wringing.<br />
[1162200020] The way the world is, I'd say it's a wonder people don't lash out more often.  </p>
<h3>11623</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1162300000] There is no denying it, now.<br />
[1162300010] A culling appears to be on the cards.<br />
[1162300020] One that won't overlook even an aging soldier as myself...  </p>
<h3>11624</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1162400000] Righteous Tarnished.<br />
[1162400010] You should have taken stock of your limitations.  </p>
<h3>11625</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1162500000] I only wanted to play my part...<br />
[1162500010] Curse these ageing bones...  </p>
<h3>11626</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1162600000] So, you would cull an old man such as I?<br />
[1162600010] You are thorough indeed, Lady Leda. I would expect nothing less.<br />
[1162600020] As you surmise, I do have my doubts.<br />
[1162600030] And will not simply lay down and die with them.  </p>
<h3>11627</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1162700000] Have you lost your wits?<br />
[1162700010] By my troth, you have no such debt to this old man.<br />
[1162700020] Though I gladly welcome your decision.<br />
[1162700030] Now I might even live to see the morrow...  </p>
<h3>11628</h3>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1162810000] Lady Leda, I ask you keep Kindly Miquella in your care.  </p>
<h3>11629</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1162900000] So, you would cull an old man such as I?<br />
[1162900010] You are thorough indeed, Lady Leda. I would expect nothing less.<br />
[1162900020] As you surmise, I do have my doubts.<br />
[1162900030] And will not simply lay down and die with them.  </p>
<h3>11630</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1163000000] So, you've taken Lady Leda's side.<br />
[1163000010] I'm glad she stands with an ally.<br />
[1163000020] She tends to overestimate...<br />
[1163000030] The burden she might carry alone.  </p>
<h3>11631</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1163100000] Well, this is an unexpected victory.<br />
[1163100010] It seems I have my uses yet...  </p>
<h3>11632</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1163200000] I've utterly failed you both...<br />
[1163200010] Miquella the Kind, Lord Mohg...  </p>
<h3>11633</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1163300000] I am Ansbach of the Pureblood Knights.<br />
[1163300010] I stand with blade aloft, blood afire.<br />
[1163300020] For the dignity of my lord and master, Mohg.  </p>
<h3>11634</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1163400000] Righteous Tarnished. It appears that our interests have aligned.<br />
[1163400010] A balm upon my soul it is, that we do not meet today as enemies.<br />
[1163400020] Now, my blade. Watch closely.  </p>
<h3>11635</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1163500000] Ha-hah!<br />
[1163500010] How readily the sensation returns! The runaway spirit of war!  </p>
<h3>11636</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1163600000] Lady Leda. Your suspicions were dead-on.<br />
[1163600010] In the end, I could not bury the memories.<br />
[1163600020] Of Lord Mohg, and our pact of blood.  </p>
<h3>11637</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1163700000] Well, good Freyja.<br />
[1163700010] It will be my honour to test my blade against a Redmane.  </p>
<h3>11638</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1163800000] Lord Mohg, your honour...<br />
[1163800010] Was my only...  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1163850000] Righteous Tarnished. That was an astounding battle, to be sure.<br />
[1163850010] Now I suppose this leaves only one.<br />
[1163850020] But in truth, I cannot calm my quivering. Challenging a god is no small matter.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[1163860000] Only one more to go.<br />
[1163860010] But in truth, I cannot calm my quivering. Challenging a god is no small matter.  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[1163870000] I am afraid I underestimated the lad.<br />
[1163870010] Appearing frail in both body and mind, I presumed he'd be like to stumble upon the field of battle...<br />
[1163870020] What a fool I was.<br />
[1163870030] He serves another master, but Sir Thiollier performed magnificently.<br />
[1163870040] Perhaps he too quivers with anticipation.<br />
[1163870050] As do we.  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[1163880000] Oh, something you want to get off your chest?<br />
[1163880010] Well, you needn't worry.<br />
[1163880020] It was you, wasn't it? Who defeated Lord Mohg.<br />
[1163880030] ...<br />
[1163880040] Fear not, I bear no grudge against you.<br />
[1163880050] His Eminence was felled in an honourable duel, and such are the risks of seeking Lordship.<br />
[1163880060] Besides, what right have I to complain? I blame the enchantment more than anything.<br />
[1163880070] Righteous Tarnished. We will have our victory.<br />
[1163880080] I swear upon my blood.  </p>
<h4>Section 90</h4>
<p>[1163890000] Righteous Tarnished. We will have our victory.<br />
[1163890010] I swear upon my blood.  </p>
<h3>11639</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1163900000] General Radahn. A pleasure to see you, after all this time.<br />
[1163900010] But those remains do not belong to you.<br />
[1163900020] Lord Mohg will have his dignity.  </p>
<h3>11640</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1164000000] Righteous Tarnished. Become our new lord.<br />
[1164000010] A lord not for gods, but for men.  </p>
<h3>11690</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1169000000] <attacks with a scythe - various levels of strength><br />
[1169000100] <attacks with a rapier - various levels of strength><br />
[1169000200] <taking damage from different types of attacks><br />
[1169000300] <takes a final lethal blow, and exhales a final breath>  </p>
<h3>11701</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1170100000] Ahh, Lady Leda spoke of you.<br />
[1170100010] You're that Tarnished. Guided here by Kindly Miquella. Weren't we all.<br />
[1170100020] I am Freyja. I once fought alongside General Radahn.<br />
[1170100030] In battle, you can be sure I'll hold my own.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1170110000] Oh, another thing.<br />
[1170110010] Did you speak to our dour little friend?<br />
[1170110020] If you've yet to do so, have him give you a map of the crosses' whereabouts.<br />
[1170110030] You'll find more of them dotted about these lands.<br />
[1170110040] They are Miquella the Kind's footprints.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1170120000] If you've yet to do so, be sure to have our dour little friend share his map of crosses.<br />
[1170120010] Assuming you intend to trace Kind Miquella's path...  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[1170130000] In battle, you can be sure I'll hold my own.  </p>
<h3>11702</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1170200000] Ah, well met.<br />
[1170200010] That was a fine battle indeed.<br />
[1170200020] It heartens me, that another warrior stands among us. Among the beckoned.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1170210000] Ah, Lady Leda spoke of you.<br />
[1170210010] You're that Tarnished. Guided here by Kindly Miquella. Weren't we all.<br />
[1170210020] I am Freyja. I once fought alongside General Radahn.<br />
[1170210030] You demonstrated great valour in battle.<br />
[1170210040] It heartens me, that another warrior stands among us. Among the beckoned.  </p>
<h3>11703</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1170300000] Long ago, I was stricken by scarlet rot in the Swamp of Aeonia.<br />
[1170300010] Immobile, feverish, and in great pain, I was entirely resigned to death.<br />
[1170300020] I was left behind, and only Kindly Miquella was good enough to seek me out.<br />
[1170300030] My wound was swollen and festering—exuding a most pungent odour—<br />
[1170300040] and yet he drained the poison from it.<br />
[1170300050] ...Despite my wretched visage.<br />
[1170300060] Now, I consider this wound my compass.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1170310000] Let us both take Kindly Miquella's guidance to heart.<br />
[1170310010] May we meet again on the battlefield, brave warrior.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1170320000] May we meet again on the battlefield, brave warrior.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1170350000] Do you wonder why the eternally dour fellow keeps his distance?<br />
[1170350010] He's one of the tower's hornsent.<br />
[1170350020] I can only assume he fights for his own reasons, and carries his own burdens.<br />
[1170350030] But we needn't concern ourselves with his affairs.<br />
[1170350040] He, too, was charmed by Kindly Miquella, and guided here.<br />
[1170350050] And that makes us allies.<br />
[1170350060] We're not gods, you and I. Even if we did manage to dig up the secrets of his past...<br />
[1170350070] I doubt our meddling could ever amount to much.  </p>

<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1170400000] Oh, there you are.<br />
[1170400010] Good. If you happen to see Lady Leda,<br />
[1170400020] tell her that I'm striking out on my own.<br />
[1170400030] Don't worry. I've no mind to cross any of you.<br />
[1170400040] The guidance of Kind Miquella remains etched into my very flesh.<br />
[1170400050] It's only, there's something that I must know.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1170410000] Ah, Lady Leda spoke of you.<br />
[1170410010] You're that Tarnished. Guided here by Kindly Miquella. Weren't we all.<br />
[1170410020] I am Freyja. I once fought alongside General Radahn.<br />
[1170410030] You picked quite the time to show up, with the enchantment having faded...<br />
[1170410040] No matter. If you happen to see Lady Leda,<br />
[1170410050] tell her that I'm striking out on my own.<br />
[1170410060] Don't worry. I've no mind to cross any of you.<br />
[1170410070] The guidance of Kind Miquella remains etched into my very flesh.<br />
[1170410080] It's only, there's something that I must know.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1170420000] Ahh, Lady Leda spoke of you.<br />
[1170420010] You're that Tarnished. Guided here by Kindly Miquella. Weren't we all.<br />
[1170420020] I am Freyja. I once fought alongside General Radahn.<br />
[1170420030] You demonstrated great valour in battle.<br />
[1170420040] But this wasn't the best time to show up, now the enchantment's faded...<br />
[1170420050] No matter. If you happen to see Lady Leda,<br />
[1170420060] tell her that I'm striking out on my own.<br />
[1170420070] Don't worry. I've no mind to cross any of you.<br />
[1170420080] The guidance of Kind Miquella remains etched into my very flesh.<br />
[1170420090] It's only, there's something that I must know.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[1170430000] I'll be out on my own for some time.<br />
[1170430010] There's something I must know.  </p>
<h3>11705</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1170500000] Kindly Miquella spoke...<br />
[1170500010] of the vow he once made with General Radahn.<br />
[1170500020] And...it is here the vow shall be honoured.<br />
[1170500030] I am a Redmane.<br />
[1170500040] I must know the nature of the vow.  </p>
<h3>11706</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1170600000] There is no need for concern.<br />
[1170600010] I will be true to my word.<br />
[1170600020] Though I do feel a hint of regret.<br />
[1170600030] Lady Leda, honourable Ansbach, and warriors like you, are all of a special breed.<br />
[1170600040] How glorious it would have been, had we met in battle as sworn enemies.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1170610000] There is no need for concern.<br />
[1170610010] I will be true to my word.<br />
[1170610020] Though I do feel a hint of regret.<br />
[1170610030] Lady Leda and honourable Ansbach are of a special breed.<br />
[1170610040] How glorious it would have been, had we met in battle as sworn enemies.  </p>
<h3>11707</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1170700000] Hmm, let me see...<br />
[1170700010] Fickle, fidgety little letters.<br />
[1170700020] I should wipe you clean off the page.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1170710000] Ahh... Now, now, Freyja. Don't let it rile you up.<br />
[1170710010] Take it slow, take it slow.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1170720000] By my lord...<br />
[1170720010] Will I ever make sense of this jumble?  </p>
<h3>11708</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1170800000] Oh. Hello.<br />
[1170800010] I'm afraid I'm busy.<br />
[1170800020] ...A curse upon my lack of foresight.<br />
[1170800030] I should have asked Ansbach to impart his knowledge when I had the chance.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1170810000] I'm afraid I'm busy.<br />
[1170810010] Truly, I should have asked Ansbach to impart his knowledge when I had the chance.  </p>
<h3>11709</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1170900000] From Sir Ansbach, to me?<br />
[1170900010] What on earth could it...<br />
[1170900020] Oh...? Hmm...?<br />
[1170900030] Yes, of course, I see.<br />
[1170900040] As the festival of war concluded, General Radahn's soul met an honourable end.<br />
[1170900050] But Kindly Miquella wishes to revive it.<br />
[1170900060] ...Which is fine by me.<br />
[1170900070] I know it would pain old Jerren, but war has always suited General Radahn best.<br />
[1170900080] And certainly far more than any honourable death.<br />
[1170900090] Endless war to invigorate the soul.<br />
[1170900100] As befits General Radahn, the great lion.  </p>
<h3>11710</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1171000000] Thank you. Now I've finally cast off my misgivings.<br />
[1171000010] Give my regards to honourable Ansbach.<br />
[1171000020] Tell him if we should meet in battle,<br />
[1171000030] to face your bow would be fine enough, but to face your blade would be an honour.  </p>
<h3>11711</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1171100010] Brave warrior. Perhaps next time we, too, will meet on the battlefield.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1171110010] All that remains is the fight. For our Kind Miquella.  </p>
<h3>11721</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1172100000] Ngh!<br />
[1172100010] What's the matter with you?  </p>
<h3>11722</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1172200000] Are you done?<br />
[1172200010] Kindly Miquella's enchantment has expired.<br />
[1172200020] It can be disorientating, to say the least.  </p>
<h3>11723</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1172300000] Looking for a fight, are you.<br />
[1172300010] Fine by me.<br />
[1172300020] Those squirmy little letters were driving me mad.<br />
[1172300030] And I've vigour to spare.  </p>
<h3>11724</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1172400000] Looking for a fight, are you.<br />
[1172400010] Haven't you any patience whatsoever?<br />
[1172400020] No matter. I could do with a warm-up.  </p>
<h3>11725</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1172500000] What a pitiful place to meet your end.<br />
[1172500010] A warrior should know—any fight might be your last.  </p>
<h3>11726</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1172600000] What's the matter with you...<br />
[1172600010] Lady Leda, beware.  </p>
<h3>11727</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1172700000] I am the Redmane, Freyja.<br />
[1172700010] The time has come.  </p>
<h3>11728</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1172800000] I could not hope for a worthier foe.<br />
[1172800010] This is our moment. Let's make it something to remember.  </p>
<h3>11729</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1172900000] I never could have imagined it.<br />
[1172900010] That you might be the Erdtree's rightful lord.<br />
[1172900020] Ha ha ha... Such as it is, this battle could not be more fitting.<br />
[1172900030] For the birth of a new god, and the coming of a lord!  </p>
<h3>11730</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1173000000] Thank you, Sir Ansbach.<br />
[1173000010] The mere sight of your blade sets my heart aflutter.<br />
[1173000020] All the more I yearn to crush it in my grasp!  </p>
<h3>11731</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1173100000] There can only be one lord.<br />
[1173100010] And you are not worthy.  </p>
<h3>11732</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1173200000] I offer this fight...<br />
[1173200010] To Miquella the Kind. And Rada...  </p>
<h3>11733</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1173300000] You were fine...in your part...<br />
[1173300010] Truly, a glorious battle...it was...  </p>
<h3>11790</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1179000000] <attacks with a curved greatsword - various levels of strength><br />
[1179000100] <long warcry><br />
[1179000200] <taking damage from different types of attacks><br />
[1179000300] <takes a final lethal blow, and exhales a final breath>  </p>
<h3>11801</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1180100000] Ahh, were you guided here by Kindly Miquella?<br />
[1180100010] I am Leda. And like you, I was guided by faith along his honourable path.<br />
[1180100020] Touch the withered arm, and you too, will be transported.<br />
[1180100030] To the realm of shadow where Miquella the Kind now dwells.<br />
[1180100040] My compatriots are there already.<br />
[1180100050] Like us, they have heard Kindly Miquella's call.<br />
[1180100060] If you can find them, they are certain to lend you aid.  </p>
<h3>11802</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1180200000] Come, now. Touch the withered arm, and travel to the realm of shadow.<br />
[1180200010] I will not be far behind. May we meet again.  </p>
<h3>11803</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1180300000] Hello again.<br />
[1180300010] Did you meet my compatriots?<br />
[1180300020] They're quite the congregation. From places as far and wide as you can imagine.<br />
[1180300030] Doubtless they'd have all come to blows at first glance...<br />
[1180300040] Were it not for the charm Kindly Miquella put upon us.<br />
[1180300060] This is what allows us to serve together.<br />
[1180300070] The work of a living god.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1180310000] We are all utterly captivated by Kindly Miquella.<br />
[1180310010] It is what binds us together.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1180320000] Oh, that man is known as Dane.<br />
[1180320010] He's been in the service of Miquella the Kind longer than I.<br />
[1180320020] He might be solemn of cheer, but is a fierce warrior nevertheless.<br />
[1180320030] There's no cause for concern—<br />
[1180320040] Dane's reluctance to speak to you is no fault of your own.<br />
[1180320050] We've been acquainted for quite some time, but even I am yet to hear his voice.<br />
[1180320060] Perhaps one day.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[1180330000] Wondering about the hornsent, are you?<br />
[1180330010] True enough, in any other circumstance he'd be at our throats...<br />
[1180330020] Long ago, Queen Marika commanded Sir Messmer to purge the tower folk.<br />
[1180330030] A cleansing by fire.<br />
[1180330040] It's no wonder the hornsent holds the Erdtree in contempt.<br />
[1180330050] That aside, man is by nature a creature of conquest.<br />
[1180330060] And in this regard, the tower folk are no different.<br />
[1180330070] They were never saints.<br />
[1180330080] They just happened to be on the losing side of a war.<br />
[1180330090] But it's still a wretched shame.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1180350000] Ah, finally we meet.<br />
[1180350010] I am Leda. I missed my chance to speak with you last time,<br />
[1180350020] but you too must have been guided here by Kindly Miquella.<br />
[1180350030] Have you met my compatriots?<br />
[1180350040] They were drawn here by Miquella the Kind, much like you, following the path he himself trod.<br />
[1180350050] You must have been surprised to see such a band, each come from places far and wide...<br />
[1180350060] Doubtless they'd have all come to blows at first glance...<br />
[1180350070] Were it not for the charm Kindly Miquella put upon us.<br />
[1180350080] That is what allows us to serve together.<br />
[1180350090] The work of a living god.  </p>
<h3>11804</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1180400000] Oh, hello.<br />
[1180400010] Did you feel it? Miquella the Kind's enchantment appears to have broken.<br />
[1180400020] But while my devotion to Kindly Miquella remains unchanged,<br />
[1180400030] by my troth, I am not so sure about the others.<br />
[1180400040] No, wait. Perhaps this is a blessing in disguise.<br />
[1180400050] I can wield my sword to cull the undeserving, those unfit to bask in Tender Miquella's presence.<br />
[1180400060] I should've thought of this earlier.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1180410000] Right. It's time to begin ferreting out....<br />
[1180410010] Those of us who don't deserve to be at Kindly Miquella's side...  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1180420000] Ah, finally we meet.<br />
[1180420010] I am Leda. I missed my chance to speak with you last time,<br />
[1180420020] but you too must have been guided here by Miquella the Kind.<br />
[1180420030] Then you must have felt it. Tender Miquella's enchantment has broken.<br />
[1180420040] But while my devotion to Kindly Miquella remains unchanged,<br />
[1180420050] by my troth, I am not so sure about the others.<br />
[1180420060] No, wait. Perhaps this is a blessing in disguise.<br />
[1180420070] I can wield my sword to cull the undeserving, those unfit to bask in Miquella the Kind's presence.<br />
[1180420080] I should've thought of this earlier.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1180450000] Thiollier, hmm.<br />
[1180450010] It's true, his devotion to St. Trina is plain to see.<br />
[1180450020] I fear his vows to Miquella the Kind are merely secondary.<br />
[1180450030] But for this very reason, Thiollier is incapable of betrayal.<br />
[1180450040] St. Trina's love for Kind Miquella is boundless.<br />
[1180450050] She is, after all, his other half. Or perhaps her feelings go beyond even that.<br />
[1180450060] Even if she was left behind, I doubt her heart would waver.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[1180460000] The hornsent, hmm.<br />
[1180460010] On one hand, he trusts Miquella the Kind to bring salvation to his people.<br />
[1180460020] With the enchantment lifted, his vengeful passions may once again ignite, but surely he'd be mindful of Kindly Miquella's promise...<br />
[1180460030] On the other hand, the hornsent does present his own dangers.<br />
[1180460040] Perhaps your concerns are well-founded after all.<br />
[1180460050] Allow me some time to mull it over.  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[1180470000] Allow me some time to mull it over.  </p>
<h3>11805</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1180500000] Oh, there you are.<br />
[1180500010] I've made up my mind—<br />
[1180500020] The hornsent will be eliminated.<br />
[1180500030] If he were to point his blade at Sir Messmer or Queen Marika, perhaps it would not matter.<br />
[1180500040] But vengeance changes a man.<br />
[1180500050] And one day, his blade may turn towards Miquella the Kind.<br />
[1180500060] Kindly Miquella is, after all, the true golden child.<br />
[1180500070] Even if he discards every last drop of his being,<br />
[1180500080] his lineage will always remain.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1180510000] Oh, there you are.<br />
[1180510010] It took me long enough, I know, but I've made my decision.<br />
[1180510020] I believe it wisest to eliminate the hornsent.<br />
[1180510030] If he were to point his blade at Sir Messmer or Queen Marika, perhaps it would not matter.<br />
[1180510040] But vengeance changes a man.<br />
[1180510050] And one day, his blade may turn towards Miquella the Kind.<br />
[1180510060] Kindly Miquella is, after all, the true golden child.<br />
[1180510070] Even if he discards every last drop of his being,<br />
[1180510080] his lineage will always remain.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1180520000] I believe the hornsent suspects what I have in mind.<br />
[1180520010] He never placed his full trust in me, even under the effect of Kindly Miquella's spell.<br />
[1180520020] He must've recognised something. The scent of the killer that slept within me.<br />
[1180520030] The stench of crusted blood.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[1180530000] I will follow the hornsent.<br />
[1180530010] To have his revenge on Sir Messmer, there is only one place he will go.<br />
[1180530020] The black keep.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1180550000] Oh, there you are.<br />
[1180550010] It took me long enough, I know, but I've made my decision.<br />
[1180550020] I'm going to leave the hornsent to his own devices.<br />
[1180550030] With his grudge against Sir Messmer settled, his blade is bent by madness.<br />
[1180550040] Wherever he goes he won't last long. I needn't bother with him.<br />
[1180550050] Unruly emotions only lead to misfortune.<br />
[1180550060] All the more reason we need someone like Miquella the Kind.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[1180560000] Oh, there you are.<br />
[1180560010] It took me long enough, I know, but I've made my decision.<br />
[1180560020] I'm going to leave the hornsent to his own devices.<br />
[1180560030] With the object of his vengeance gone, his blade has grown dull.<br />
[1180560040] In that state, I don't imagine he will ever fight again. I needn't bother with him.<br />
[1180560050] Lest, of course, another target for his retribution should appear.  </p>
<h3>11806</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1180600000] Oh, there you are.<br />
[1180600010] Well fought. You have my gratitude.<br />
[1180600020] He was never going to see eye to eye with us,<br />
[1180600030] but his words were ill-founded.<br />
[1180600040] It was hard to hear, I know.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1180610000] I know I shouldn't let myself...<br />
[1180610010] But I suppose it's only natural to feel the weight of one's deeds at times like these.<br />
[1180610020] There is plenty left to be done. And I will see to it.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1180620000] Who else, I wonder....<br />
[1180620010] I don't enjoy casting suspicion on anyone I've called a comrade.<br />
[1180620020] But it's a small sacrifice in the grand scheme of things. We must eradicate all doubt...  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1180650000] Oh, there you are.<br />
[1180650010] I've made up my mind—<br />
[1180650020] The hornsent is no longer a mortal danger.<br />
[1180650030] With his grudge against Sir Messmer settled, his blade is bent by madness.<br />
[1180650040] Wherever he goes he won't last long. I needn't bother with him.<br />
[1180650050] Unruly emotions only lead to misfortune.<br />
[1180650060] All the more reason we need someone like Miquella the Kind.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[1180660000] Oh, there you are.<br />
[1180660010] I've made up my mind—<br />
[1180660020] The hornsent is no longer a mortal danger.<br />
[1180660030] With the object of his vengeance gone, his blade has grown dull.<br />
[1180660040] In that state, I don't imagine he will ever fight again. I needn't bother with him.<br />
[1180660050] Lest, of course, another target for his retribution should appear.  </p>
<h3>11807</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1180700000] Ah, there you are.<br />
[1180700010] I'm afraid Sir Ansbach will have to be next.<br />
[1180700020] He insists that he's nothing but a worn-down, over-the-hill soldier.<br />
[1180700030] But in his day, he was the feared commander of the Pureblood Knights,<br />
[1180700040] who cleaved open Miquella the Kind with his blood blade.<br />
[1180700050] He claims he hasn't the spirit to take up his sword again,<br />
[1180700060] but I doubt it'll be very long...<br />
[1180700070] Before he recalls, as I have, the cascading sheets of blood.<br />
[1180700080] I'm afraid he cannot be left to fester...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1180710000] I've come to a realisation...<br />
[1180710010] There's ample evidence... Without Kindly Miquella's influence...<br />
[1180710020] I'm quite mistrustful of others...  </p>
<h3>11808</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1180800000] Ah, there you are.<br />
[1180800010] I owe you for your help in battle, once again.<br />
[1180800020] Sir Ansbach must have considered it an honourable end, being felled by your hand.<br />
[1180800030] After all, the good fellow held you in the highest regard.<br />
[1180800040] When we speak of it, we may speak with pride—that we were Sir Ansbach's final adversaries.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[1180801010] I appreciate the help in battle.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1180810000] Ah, there you are.<br />
[1180810010] I owe you for your help in battle, once again.<br />
[1180810020] None can deny Sir Ansbach was truly a great man.<br />
[1180810030] We can be proud, that we were the last opponents he ever faced.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[1180811010] I appreciate the help in battle.  </p>
<h3>11809</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1180900000] You are an odd one, aren't you.<br />
[1180900010] The enchantment is broken, and yet you alone appear completely unchanged.<br />
[1180900020] As if nothing was ever cast upon you.<br />
[1180900030] ...<br />
[1180900040] No matter.<br />
[1180900050] If you found your way here, it was because Kindly Miquella wished it so.<br />
[1180900060] But I am afraid this is our farewell.<br />
[1180900070] When next we meet, let it be under the eyes of Miquella the Kind.<br />
[1180900080] Good bye, comrade.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1180910000] I'm afraid this is our farewell, comrade.<br />
[1180910010] When next we meet, let it be under the eyes of Miquella the Kind.  </p>
<h3>11810</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1181000000] Ah, I thought I'd see you here.<br />
[1181000010] It's been quite some time.<br />
[1181000020] ...<br />
[1181000030] It was never Kindly Miquella, was it? The Erdtree was leading you all along.<br />
[1181000040] So that you might ascend to lordship.<br />
[1181000050] Why come to these lands to begin with?<br />
[1181000060] I suppose it must be what his Eminence, or perhaps the Erdtree, desired all along?<br />
[1181000070] The clashing of the favoured lords, such that one would prevail?<br />
[1181000080] So be it.<br />
[1181000090] If you insist upon facing Miquella the Kind,<br />
[1181000100] Then I will run you through, whoever you might be.<br />
[1181000110] Don't tarry now.  </p>
<h3>11811</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1181100000] Worthy hornsent. I will dispose of you.<br />
[1181100010] Before your thirst for revenge beckons our undoing.<br />
[1181100020] I can no longer trust your word.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1181110000] What a surprise. That you should join me here.<br />
[1181110010] I am pleased. Now go and make yourself useful.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1181120000] Kindly Miquella never betrays a vow.<br />
[1181120010] Go. Your family awaits you.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[1181130000] Y-You have bested me.<br />
[1181130010] Only...  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[1181140000] Worthy hornsent. I will dispose of you.<br />
[1181140010] Before your thirst for revenge beckons our undoing.<br />
[1181140020] I can no longer trust your word.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1181150000] Have you been taken in by the plight of the hornsent?<br />
[1181150010] Foolish...<br />
[1181150020] But hardly unexpected. Man is a compassionate animal, for better or worse.  </p>
<h4>Section 65</h4>
<p>[1181165000] I expected things to end differently with you.<br />
[1181165010] What a pity.  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[1181170000] Urgh! You have bested me.<br />
[1181170010] A single betrayal, enough to turn the tides...<br />
[1181170020] Unfortunate. But I will leave you be, for now.  </p>
<h3>11812</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1181200000] Sir Ansbach. I will dispose of you.<br />
[1181200010] I find that I have a new apprehension—<br />
[1181200020] Your ambivalence. And exactly where it might lead you...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1181210000] You've come again, have you.<br />
[1181210010] Thank you. Now go and make yourself useful.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1181220000] Well, fancy meeting you here.<br />
[1181220010] I am pleased. Now go and make yourself useful.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[1181230000] Thank you for all that you have done.<br />
[1181230010] Sir Ansbach.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[1181240000] You are a force of nature...<br />
[1181240010] Only...  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1181250000] Sir Ansbach. I will dispose of you.<br />
[1181250010] I find that I have a new apprehension—<br />
[1181250020] Your ambivalence. And exactly where it might lead you.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[1181260000] So you've chosen your side, have you.<br />
[1181260010] Despite having no debt to the Lord of Blood.<br />
[1181260020] I suppose it was Sir Ansbach who won you over.<br />
[1181260030] Fine. One more heart for my blade to skewer.  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[1181270000] With this battle I send you on. It was an honour.<br />
[1181270010] Now, go.  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[1181280000] Perhaps I should have known.<br />
[1181280010] Not to challenge the two of you alone.<br />
[1181280020] I take my leave, for now.  </p>
<h3>11813</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1181300000] Don't you dare approach Miquella the Kind.<br />
[1181300010] Needle Knight Leda, Dryleaf Dane, and our allies...<br />
[1181300020] Will never allow this.<br />
[1181300050] Will never allow this.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[1181302040] Needle Knight Leda, Dryleaf Dane, and our ally...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1181310000] Don't you dare approach Miquella the Kind.<br />
[1181310010] Needle Knight Leda and Dryleaf Dane...<br />
[1181310020] Will never allow this.<br />
[1181310050] Will never allow this.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1181320000] I am sorry.<br />
[1181320010] For speaking to you as a compatriot.<br />
[1181320020] When we stood before the withered arm.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[1181330000] By way of apology, I will reveal the marrow of my sword.<br />
[1181330010] Its needles, that will stitch you into death.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[1181340000] I can't fathom your convictions.<br />
[1181340010] After knowing Kindly Miquella, what remains to pledge to your Lord of Blood?  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1181350000] Thiollier.<br />
[1181350010] I seem to have made a poor judgement.<br />
[1181350020] About you. Or perhaps, St. Trina.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[1181360000] With this battle I send you on. It was an honour to face a worthy lord.<br />
[1181360010] Now, go.  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[1181370000] Kindly Miquella...<br />
[1181370010] Make the world... A gentler place...  </p>
<h3>11890</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1189000100] <taking damage from different types of attacks><br />
[1189000200] <takes a final lethal blow, and exhales a final breath>  </p>
<h3>11901</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1190100000] Oh, hello there.<br />
[1190100010] Are you the Tarnished?<br />
[1190100020] Lady Leda spoke of you.<br />
[1190100030] Another Tarnished, guided here by Miquella the Kind.<br />
[1190100040] My name is Thiollier.<br />
[1190100050] I, too, am Tarnished, and here on Kindly Miquella's account.<br />
[1190100060] So, well...<br />
[1190100070] Here's to new beginnings, I suppose.  </p>
<h3>11902</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1190200000] Um, I'm sorry...<br />
[1190200010] But, well, I'm not much good at anything, is all.<br />
[1190200020] I'm as weak as a kitten and thick as two planks.<br />
[1190200030] I've always been this way...since the very day I was born.<br />
[1190200040] I'm afraid the only thing I’m proficient in is...is poison...<br />
[1190200050] Sorry...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1190210000] So, um, what can I help you with?  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1190220000] Um...<br />
[1190220010] Just give me the word if you need any more poison.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1190250000] Oh, what's this!<br />
[1190250010] I have to say, Sir Moore has an awfully sharp eye, doesn't he.<br />
[1190250020] It's wonderful. This ebony, as lustrous as the night sky unending.<br />
[1190250030] I don't think I could ever thank him enough...<br />
[1190250040] But I'll have to think of something...  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[1190260000] Ahh, forgive me.<br />
[1190260010] You too deserve your share of the reward.<br />
[1190260020] I'll mix up something special.<br />
[1190260030] If you find yourself...weary of the weight of this life, then just give me the word.<br />
[1190260040] Sleep is a balm, and eternal sleep...is an elixir.  </p>
<h3>11903</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1190300000] Is that so?<br />
[1190300010] Then take this.<br />
[1190300020] This concoction can coax even the oldest of dragons to sleep.<br />
[1190300030] For you, it will grant the sweetest slumber...<br />
[1190300040] ...for all eternity.  </p>
<h3>11904</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1190400000] Oh, umm...<br />
[1190400010] Are you not affected? Even with the spell broken?<br />
[1190400020] I'm feeling rather lost. Haunted by memories.<br />
[1190400030] Of St. Trina. Her visage. Her scent. The lure of velvety sleep.<br />
[1190400040] Would Kindly Miquella chasten me?<br />
[1190400050] For falling for St. Trina, while knowing that she was the discarded half?<br />
[1190400060] The problem is...I simply cannot help it.<br />
[1190400070] I would sacrifice everything, just to gaze upon her, one last time.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1190410000] I'm feeling rather lost. Haunted by memories.<br />
[1190410010] Of St. Trina.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1190450000] Oh, hello there.<br />
[1190450010] Are you the Tarnished?<br />
[1190450020] Lady Leda spoke of you.<br />
[1190450030] Another Tarnished, guided here by Miquella the Kind.<br />
[1190450040] My name is Thiollier.<br />
[1190450050] I, too, am Tarnished, and here on Kindly Miquella's account.<br />
[1190450060] Oh, umm...<br />
[1190450070] Are you not affected? Even with the spell broken?  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[1190460000] I'm feeling rather lost. Haunted by memories.<br />
[1190460010] Of St. Trina. Her visage. Her scent. The lure of velvety sleep.<br />
[1190460020] Would Kindly Miquella chasten me?<br />
[1190460030] For falling for St. Trina, while knowing that she was the discarded half?<br />

<h3>11905</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1190500000] Umm, oh...<br />
[1190500010] I had something I wish to tell you.<br />
[1190500020] I'm heading south.<br />
[1190500030] I've recalled something that Sir Moore said.<br />
[1190500040] He discovered deep-purple water lilies blooming on the southern shore.<br />
[1190500050] That must be where St. Trina was left to wither away.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1190510000] I'm heading south.<br />
[1190510010] To the shore Sir Moore mentioned.  </p>
<h3>11906</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1190600000] Are...are you certain of this?<br />
[1190600010] Is this all a plot to make a mockery of me?<br />
[1190600020] ...<br />
[1190600030] Oh, heavens, what am I saying. Forgive me.<br />
[1190600040] You deserve my deepest gratitude.<br />
[1190600050] I will make the journey.<br />
[1190600060] To the southern coast, as you say. To venture into the depths of the fissure.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1190610000] I will make the journey.<br />
[1190610010] To the southern coast, as you say. To venture into the depths of the fissure.  </p>
<h3>11907</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1190700000] St. Trina...<br />
[1190700010] Oh, St. Trina...<br />
[1190700020] What velvety ambrosia is this?<br />
[1190700030] Your poison, and the sweet sleep that follows.<br />
[1190700040] Oh, please, let me hear your voice...  </p>
<h3>11908</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1190800000] Ah, hello.<br />
[1190800010] Thank you for your help.<br />
[1190800020] Without it, I wouldn't have seen St. Trina again.<br />
[1190800030] I'm drifting off in the sea of her poison.<br />
[1190800040] Soon, I will hear her voice.<br />
[1190800050] Let me be. I won't be long.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1190810000] Ah, hello.<br />
[1190810010] Thank you. It was all just as you said.<br />
[1190810020] To think, without your guidance, I wouldn't have seen St. Trina again.<br />
[1190810030] I'm drifting off in the sea of her poison.<br />
[1190810040] Soon, I will hear her voice.<br />
[1190810050] Let me be. I won't be long.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1190820000] Ahh, then you, too, must have paid a visit...<br />
[1190820010] To St. Trina's garden of deepest purple.<br />
[1190820020] I'm drifting off in the sea of her poison.<br />
[1190820030] Soon, I will hear her voice.<br />
[1190820040] Let me be. I won't be long.  </p>
<h3>11909</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1190900000] Oh, I almost forgot.<br />
[1190900010] You mustn't follow my example.<br />
[1190900020] St. Trina's poison would plunge you into an eternal slumber.<br />
[1190900030] It must be me, and only me.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1190910000] I am gone, adrift in sleep.<br />
[1190910010] So that I may hear St. Trina's lost voice.<br />
[1190910020] Let me be. I won't be long.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1190950000] St. Trina.<br />
[1190950010] Why won't you share your voice with me?<br />
[1190950020] Ahh, grant me more of your poison.<br />
[1190950030] That I might drift further into sleep.<br />
[1190950040] Perhaps then you'll grace me with your voice?  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[1190960000] Please. Leave me alone.  </p>
<h3>11910</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1191000000] I'll thank you not to lie to me.<br />
[1191000010] I am the chosen, not you.<br />
[1191000020] Only I can doze off in the sea of St. Trina.<br />
[1191000030] Why would you hear her voice, when I cannot?<br />
[1191000040] If you should utter these cruel untruths to me again I...<br />
[1191000050] I won't be held responsible for my actions...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1191010000] Never utter these cruel untruths to me again...  </p>
<h3>11911</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1191100000] Please, enough.<br />
[1191100010] I cannot believe your cheek.<br />
[1191100020] And I will stand for it no longer!  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1191110000] I will never forgive you.  </p>
<h3>11912</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1191200000] Ah, you...<br />
[1191200010] I was no good to anyone, beginning to end.<br />
[1191200020] Weak as a kitten and thick as two planks.<br />
[1191200030] I suppose dying in disgrace is fitting, in a way...<br />
[1191200040] Ha...ha...<br />
[1191200050] Tell me, please.<br />
[1191200060] Assuming you spoke the truth back then...<br />
[1191200070] What did St. Trina tell you?  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1191210000] Tell me, please.<br />
[1191210010] Assuming you spoke the truth back then...<br />
[1191210020] What did St. Trina tell you?  </p>
<h3>11913</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1191300000] Ahh, you are a wretched, wretched soul...<br />
[1191300010] A nightmare, come to plague me.<br />
[1191300020] Such a thing...couldn't possibly be...<br />
[1191300030] Could it? St. Trina.<br />
[1191300040] Please, let me hear your voice.<br />
[1191300050] In my everlasting slumber...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1191310000] St. Trina, let me hear your voice.<br />

<p>[1191320000] ...A-Ah...  </p>
<h3>11914</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1191400000] I will never forgive you.<br />
[1191400010] For your trespass, you will know my poison...  </p>
<h3>11915</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1191500000] Never utter these untruths again.<br />
[1191500010] St. Trina would never say such things.  </p>
<h3>11916</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1191600000] Why did you mislead me?<br />
[1191600010] Such strength, but for what...  </p>
<h3>11917</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1191700000] I am here to serve St. Trina, evermore.  </p>
<h3>11918</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1191800000] I am deeply sorry. For doubting you.<br />
[1191800010] I am here only to grant St. Trina's singular wish.<br />
[1191800020] I will stop Miquella the Kind.<br />
[1191800030] He will never become a god.  </p>
<h3>11919</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1191900000] Not the finest blade, nor the mightiest armour...<br />
[1191900010] will spare your life. From the poison of Thiollier.  </p>
<h3>11920</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1192000000] Sir Moore. I do not wish to fight you.<br />
[1192000010] But I have new purpose I must see through.  </p>
<h3>11921</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1192100000] You have no understanding.<br />
[1192100010] Of Kind Miquella. Of St. Trina's love...  </p>

<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1192200000] I am here to serve St. Trina, evermore.  </p>

<p>[1192300000] Sorry. It's up to you now.<br />
[1192300010] Grant St. Trina's one wish.  </p>

<p>[1200100000] Well. We don't often receive visitors.<br />
[1200100010] I am Ymir. Welcome, to Manus Metyr.<br />
[1200100020] It is a pleasure to have you.<br />
[1200100030] In lands so forsaken as these, chance encounters are precious indeed.<br />
[1200100040] Seeing that we have convened here on this day,<br />
[1200100050] allow me to mark the occasion with a modest offering.  </p>
<h3>12002</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1200200000] The map I gave you charts the site of a hallowed ruin.<br />
[1200200010] It is said that after sounding the hanging bell there...<br />
[1200200020] One's fate will be guided by the stars.<br />
[1200200030] I only wish to be of service.<br />
[1200200040] To help those who fight for their purpose.<br />
[1200200050] I'm not mistaken am I? I can see it in your eyes.<br />
[1200200060] You are a fighter, are you not?  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1200250000] Is something the matter?<br />
[1200250010] I've given you a map to the hallowed ruin...<br />
[1200250020] Oh, I suppose you expect a lesson of me, do you.<br />
[1200250030] I know the feeling. Those with purpose are nothing if not ravenous...<br />
[1200250040] For power. For truth.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[1200260000] Is something the matter?<br />
[1200260010] Here to squeeze another lesson out of me?  </p>
<h3>12003</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1200300000] Oh, yes.<br />
[1200300010] Do mind your feet around the church.<br />
[1200300020] You wouldn't want to hurt the little boy.  </p>
<h3>12004</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1200400000] Oh my, you poor thing.<br />
[1200400010] Another bad dream, Yuri?<br />
[1200400020] Put that rotten thing out of your mind.<br />
[1200400030] That tangled mess can't hurt you.  </p>
<h3>12005</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1200500000] I am a glintstone sorcerer.<br />
[1200500010] We study the stars, and examine the life therein.<br />
[1200500020] Are you familiar with our findings?<br />
[1200500030] Long ago, we began as stardust, born of a great rupture far across the skies.<br />
[1200500040] We, too, are children of the Greater Will.<br />
[1200500050] Is that not divine? Is that not sublime?<br />
[1200500060] ...and yet, none can fathom its implications, its utter brilliance!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[1200501000] I, too, am a glintstone sorcerer.  </p>
<h3>12006</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1200600000] Ah, you met Jolán?<br />
[1200600010] Well, I hope that she behaved, at least.<br />
[1200600020] The poor girl has overcome grave misfortune.<br />
[1200600030] Her tongue can be sharp at the best of times,<br />
[1200600040] but don't think that makes her a bad person.<br />
[1200600050] Mm. It's no surprise her little sister too, has a heart of gold.  </p>
<h3>12007</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1200700000] Oh, there you are.<br />
[1200700010] The exalted timbre of the bell has reached these ears of mine.<br />
[1200700020] Gracious, the starry sky is wondrous tonight indeed.<br />
[1200700030] Only your fate shines brighter.<br />
[1200700040] Now, these are for you.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[1200701000] Think nothing of it.<br />
[1200701010] I have made my decision to be of help.<br />
[1200701020] May the gleaming stars guide you evermore.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1200710000] Oh, there you are.<br />
[1200710010] The exalted timbre of the bell has reached these ears of mine.<br />
[1200710020] Gracious, the starry sky is wondrous tonight indeed.<br />
[1200710030] Only your fate shines brighter.<br />
[1200710040] But fate can be a strange thing indeed.<br />
[1200710050] The hanging bell you sounded was not the one on the map I gave you.<br />
[1200710060] The bell you found was in fact, here.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[1200711000] Please, take a second look at the original map.<br />
[1200711010] And may the gleaming stars guide you evermore.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1200720000] Oh, hello. Is something the matter?  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[1200730000] May the gleaming stars guide you evermore.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1200750000] Forgive me.<br />
[1200750010] I failed you. Failed to birth you whole.<br />
[1200750020] I was not ready to be your mother.<br />
[1200750030] But I can still stay here, nice and close.<br />
[1200750040] For now, my dear, sleep soundly...  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[1200760000] I will return shortly.<br />
[1200760010] Please, allow the two of us a moment alone.  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[1200770000] Hmm?<br />
[1200770010] Did you espy something unsightly, perchance?<br />
[1200770020] Well, put it out of your mind.<br />
[1200770030] The stars will reveal the truth, in time.<br />
[1200770040] Free yourself of any misconceptions, lest they bring woe upon the both of us.  </p>
<h3>12008</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1200800000] I fear that you have borne witness to the whole of it.<br />
[1200800010] The conceits—the hypocrisy—of the world built upon the Erdtree. The follies of men. Their bitter suffering.<br />
[1200800020] Is there no hope for redemption?<br />
[1200800030] The answer, sadly, is clear.<br />
[1200800040] There never was any hope. They were each of them defective. Unhinged, from the start.<br />
[1200800050] Marika herself. And the fingers that guided her.<br />
[1200800060] And this is what troubles me.<br />
[1200800070] No matter our efforts, if the roots are rotten,<br />
[1200800080] ...then we have little recourse.  </p>
<h3>12009</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1200900000] Ever-young Miquella saw things for what they were.<br />
[1200900010] He knew that his bloodline was tainted. His roots mired in madness.<br />
[1200900020] A tragedy if ever there was one.<br />
[1200900030] That he would feel compelled to renounce everything.<br />
[1200900040] When the blame...lay squarely with the mother.  </p>
<h3>12010</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1201000000] Mm. Hello there.<br />
[1201000010] I heard another sound, coloured by your essence.<br />
[1201000020] Simply exhilarating, I must say.<br />
[1201000030] The stars are dark tonight.<br />
[1201000040] But rest assured, this is no ill omen.<br />
[1201000050] On the contrary. I believe that this portends a magnificent starry cascade.<br />
[1201000060] Now, take this, my final gift to you.<br />
[1201000070] May you join the glimmering stars above.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1201010000] Mm. Hello there.<br />
[1201010010] The exalted timbre of the bells has reached these ears of mine.<br />
[1201010020] Twice, now. How very exhilarating, indeed.<br />
[1201010030] The stars are dark tonight.<br />
[1201010040] But rest assured, this is no ill omen.<br />
[1201010050] On the contrary. I believe that this portends a magnificent starry cascade.<br />
[1201010060] Now, take this, my final gift to you.<br />
[1201010070] May you join the glimmering stars above.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1201020000] Oh, yes. I believe I can feel it brewing.<br />
[1201020010] This evening is a sign, of a greater night to come.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[1201030000] May you join the glimmering stars above.  </p>
<h3>12011</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1201100000] Do you recall what I said?<br />
[1201100010] That Marika, and the fingers that guided her, were unsound from the start.<br />
[1201100020] Well, the truth lies deeper still.<br />
[1201100030] It is their mother who is damaged and unhinged.<br />
[1201100040] The fingers are but unripe children. Victims in their own right.<br />
[1201100050] We all need a mother, do we not?<br />
[1201100060] A new mother, a true mother, who will not give birth to further malady.  </p>
<h3>12012</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1201200000] Forgive me.<br />
[1201200010] I failed you. Failed to birth you whole.<br />
[1201200020] But it won't be long now.<br />
[1201200030] I will soon be a mother. I will give you new life.<br />
[1201200040] I assure you, you will have life.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[1201210000] Please, will you allow the two of us this time alone?<br />
[1201210010] It isn't much to ask.  </p>
<h3>12013</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1201300000] My shining star.<br />
[1201300010] Grant me a mother's strength.<br />
[1201300020] Look here. At my fingers.<br />
[1201300030] I will be the true mother.<br />
[1201300040] And I will be the only mother!  </p>
<h3>12014</h3>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[1201450000] I will be the true mother!<br />
[1201450010] Dear Yuri, dear Fingers!  </p>
<h3>12015</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1201500000] Forgive me, Yuri.<br />
[1201500010] Truly, I desired...to be your mother...  </p>
<h3>12021</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1202100000] My dear child!<br />
[1202100010] My dear children!<br />
[1202100020] My dear finger!<br />
[1202100030] My dear fingers!  </p>
<h3>12090</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1209000100] <medium and long exertions for birthing fingers from stomach><br />
[1209000200] <taking damage from different types of attacks><br />
[1209000300] <takes a final lethal blow, and exhales a final breath>  </p>
<h3>12502</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1250200000] Kind Miquella…<br />
[1250200010] In godhood shall you rise…  </p>
<h3>12503</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1250300000] ...  </p>
<h3>12504</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1250400000] ...  </p>
<h3>15001</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1500100000] ...<br />
[1500100010] O Bayle, tyrant drake, do your wounds yet ache?<br />
[1500100020] Is your fury still yet to crest its zenith?<br />
[1500100030] Hurry, hurry, and lay it all to waste!<br />
[1500100040] Lay waste to the proud, the conceited, each,
ev'ry last one of that arrogant lot.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[1500101000] ...<br />
[1500101010] Oh, how it hurts...from very tip to toe...<br />
[1500101020] Aaah... Nnngh...<br />
[1500101030] Help me, I must ask... Am I human still?<br />
[1500101040] Is that the reason...I yet suffer so?  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[1500103000] ...<br />
[1500103010] Ev'ryone...burned to cinders...burned away.<br />
[1500103020] Put to the torch...by Messmer...and his lot.<br />
[1500103030] What did we do to deserve such a fate?<br />
[1500103040] We merely lived our lives... We lived in peace...  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[1500106000] ...<br />
[1500106010] Ah-hah, my theory is proven true!<br />
[1500106020] The finger creepers hail from these ruins.<br />
[1500106030] So now must I sound this one hanging bell,<br />
[1500106040] and sweetly cradled shall I come to be,<br />
[1500106050] at the bosom...of the exalted mother.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[1500117000] ...<br />
[1500117010] I know...<br />
[1500117020] All your resentment lingers yet...<br />
[1500117030] The raw stuff from which I shall surely forge<br />
[1500117040] a curse. Upon the dastard Messmer's head.
Upon Marika's children each and all.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[1500120000] ...<br />
[1500120010] I was once told a coffin could convey...
Its passenger upon a gentle cruise...<br />
[1500120020] To the velvet garden of deepest purple.<br />
[1500120030] Oh...to slumber in such a paradise...  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[1500122000] ...<br />
[1500122010] O Marika...<br />
[1500122020] I beg...embrace your child...<br />
[1500122030] And give us a sign.<br />
[1500122040] How long must this holy war stretch on?  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[1500123000] ...<br />
[1500123010] By Grace, if e'er I see another rock...<br />
[1500123020] I shall find it, of this I have no doubt.<br />
[1500123030] The altar of the forge cannot be far...  </p>
<h3>15002</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1500200000] ...<br />
[1500200010] For pity's sake, your place is in the jar.<br />
[1500200020] Nigh-sainthood itself awaits you within.<br />
[1500200030] For shamans like you, this is your lot.<br />
[1500200040] Life were you accorded for this alone.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[1500208000] ...<br />
[1500208010] Stop... Avert your gaze from me!<br />
[1500208020] I beg, look away!<br />
[1500208030] Aaargh!  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[1500217000] ...<br />
[1500217010] No, such a thing is utterly inconceivable...<br />
[1500217020] We have not been abandoned.<br />
[1500217030] Messmer is the son of Queen Marika...<br />
[1500217040] Her Grace would never abandon her own flesh and blood...  </p>
<h3>15004</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[1500400000] ...<br />
[1500400010] O please, grant me the courage...<br />
[1500400020] To fly to your feet, my dearest...<br />
[1500400030] St. Trina...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[1500402000] ...<br />
[1500402010] Kindly Miquella...<br />
[1500402020] I see you've thrown away...<br />
[1500402030] Something you should not have. Under any circumstances.<br />
[1500402040] How will you salvation offer...to those who cannot be saved?<br />
[1500402050] When you could not even save your other self?  </p>
<h3>15005</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[1500501000] ...<br />
[1500501010] O tower of ours, hidden in shadow. O lofty spiral piercing the heavens.<br />
[1500501020] Lead him safely unto greater Godhood.<br />
[1500501030] And in divinity grant our salvation.  </p>
<h3>15007</h3>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[1500705000] ...<br />
[1500705010] I welcome you, O uninvited guest.<br />
[1500705020] But must I warn, as you venture in... Heed the words of our great master, Midra.<br />
[1500705030] "Approach not the madness—lest ye succumb."  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[1500706000] ...<br />
[1500706010] I beg you stop. Haven't I taken enough?<br />
[1500706020] Are we not brethren, common in our line?<br />
[1500706030] And yet, you offer only cruelty...<br />
[1500706040] I ask; what crime did great Midra commit?  </p>
<h3>15008</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[1500801000] ...<br />
[1500801010] Oh please. Not the jar... Anything but that!<br />
[1500801020] I promise. I won't ever do it again!<br />
[1500801030] I swear—a living saint I'll surely be!<br />
[1500801040] Please...you must forgive me. Forgive me, please.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[1500803000] ...<br />
[1500803010] Please, I can't stand the sound...<br />
[1500803020] I need no salvation.<br />
[1500803030] Please, stop, desist.<br />
[1500803040] Your wretched lamentation.  </p>
